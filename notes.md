### How does the above query work even though we removed the **\n** we are used to writing in our queries ?
=> The new lines are just syntacitc sugar to enhance queries readability, but any graphql server depends on whitespaces to parse our queries . 

I haven't spent much time learning about how does a graphql server parse the query, maybe it is a topic for another time.
